# AI Demo Project Using SDE Sandbox

## Project Overview

Welcome to our AI Demo Project, showcasing the integration and application of AI technologies in Python within SDE sandbox. This project features capabilities for generating articles using OpenAI's API, and for fetching, storing, and searching web content using [Chroma DB](https://docs.trychroma.com/).

### Main Features:
- **Sitemap Fetching and Parsing**: Automates the process of fetching sitemap XML from websites and parsing it to extract URLs.
- **Content Extraction and Storage**: Retrieves and stores web page content in ChromaDB, a versatile database system.
- **AI-Powered Search**: Employs OpenAI's embedding functions for efficient and intelligent content search within ChromaDB.
- **Article Generation**: Generates articles based on user prompts and search terms, utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 turbo model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Access to an SDE such as Daytona.io which supports Dev Container Specification
- Python >3.10
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
There are two ways to set up the environment for this project:

1. **Using an SDE**:
   - Users of Daytona.io, Codeanywhere, Codespaces, or VS Code can auto-configure their environment with devcontainer.json, allowing for instant start.
   - Just point the SDE to the Git repository url: https://github.com/nkkko/ai-sandbox-demo
   - Set up an `.env` file with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. **Manual Setup**:
   - Clone the repository to your workspace or local environment.
   - Install necessary packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     Or run:
     ```
     pip install openai chromadb python-dotenv bs4 argparse lxml
     ```
   - Set up an `.env` file with your `OPENAI_API_KEY` or don't and just use the default embeddings function (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

### Usage

1. **populate.py**: 
   - Run the script with a sitemap URL to fetch, parse, and store website content. Optionally select the embeddings function to use with `--ef`.
   - Usage: `python populate.py [SITEMAP_URL] [--n [MAX_URLS]] [--ef {default|openai}]`
   - Example: `python populate.py https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml --n 100 --ef openai`

2. **search.py**:
   - Perform searches in the stored data. Optionally select the embeddings function to use with `--ef`.
   - Usage: `python search.py [SEARCH_QUERY] [--n [NUMBER_OF_RESULTS]] [--ef {default|openai}]`
   - Example: `python search.py "example search query" --n 5 --ef default`

3. **write.py**:
   - Generate articles based on a prompt and ChromaDB search terms. Optionally select the embeddings function to use with `--ef`.
   - Usage: `python write.py [PROMPT] --s [SEARCH_TERM] --n [NUMBER_OF_RESULTS] [--ef {default|openai}]`
   - Example: `python write.py "Write an article about AI" --s "artificial intelligence" --n 3 --ef openai`

The `--ef` argument allows you to specify which [embeddings function](https://docs.trychroma.com/embeddings) to use when interacting with ChromaDB. By default, `default_ef` is used (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). If you want to use OpenAI's embeddings, specify `--ef openai`.

## Structure

- `SynthSpider.py`: Core module containing the logic for fetching, parsing, storing, and searching.
- `populate.py`: Script for populating ChromaDB with content from a sitemap.
- `search.py`: Script to search within the stored data.
- `write.py`: Script to generate articles using OpenAI and ChromaDB to fetch context.
- `db/`: Directory containing ChromaDB client and utilities.
- `.env`: Environment file for storing your OpenAI API key.
- `.devcontainer`: Configuration directory with file for setting up the development environment automatically in supported SDEs.

## Examples

- Fetch and store 10 first articles from the sitemap:
  ```bash
    python populate.py https://www.daytona.io/sitemap-definitions.xml --ef azure_ef --n 10
  ```

- Search for the first two terms that are closest to the query in the stored content:
  ```bash
    python search.py "SDE" --n 2
  ```

- Generate an article within set context of the first result from the vector DB: 
  ```bash
    python write.py "Tell me a joke about" --s "guardrails" --n 1
  ```
  ```bash
    Why was the developer afraid to play cards with the guardrails?

    Because every time they tried to deal, the guardrails kept reminding them to stay within their limits! ðŸš§ðŸ˜„

python write.py "Imagine you are experienced author and writer in dev tools space. Write a short form thought leadership opinion. It needs to have less less than 200 words. These are examples of the style of opinions that you can emulate: [1. In the quest for an efficient cloud development Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the initial and crucial step involves selecting the IDE that aligns seamlessly with project needs, financial considerations, and one's skill proficiency. The diverse landscape of IDEs offers options catering to various languages, frameworks, and development styles. Careful consideration of factors like scalability, collaboration features, and integration capabilities ensures the chosen IDE enhances productivity, aligns with budget constraints, and accommodates skill levels. This strategic selection lays the foundation for a streamlined development workflow, fostering an environment conducive to innovation and success. 2. To optimize your cloud development IDE, start by selecting one that aligns with your project's needs, budget, and skill level. Consider factors like programming languages, frameworks, cloud providers, customization options, collaboration features, and reliability. Compare options based on these criteria to find the IDE that best suits your cloud development goals. 3. Post selecting your cloud IDE, optimize performance, security, and usability via configuration. Tailor the interface with theme, layout, and shortcut adjustments to align with your workflow. Enhance coding efficiency and readability by tweaking code editor, syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and formatting options. Streamline the development lifecycle with debugging, testing, and deployment tools. Bolster security through authentication and encryption features, safeguarding code and data. Regularly review and update backup, recovery, and version control options to align with best practices, ensuring your cloud IDE remains finely tuned and resilient throughout the development journey. 4. I would always suggest using an IDE that is common in most working environments, which means either VS Code, one of the JetBrains family products, or a browser version of them. It seems like a waste of time and energy to learn a new IDE that you will never use outside of that project. 5. Enhancing your cloud IDE involves leveraging extensions and pluginsâ€”additional software components offering extra features, tools, and integrations. These augment your IDE's capabilities, supporting a broader range of programming languages, frameworks, and tools relevant to your project. Extensions and plugins also facilitate integration with other cloud services and applications, improving user experience and productivity. Explore and install extensions that align with your cloud development goals, providing valuable features like code snippets, templates, themes, or widgets to optimize your development workflow.] Now write original opinion on: [what else to consider about cloud IDEs, share examples, stories, or insights ] using the following context to support your writing: " --s "cloud development environment" --n 5
